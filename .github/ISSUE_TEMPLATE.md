### Hiya! So you think it's broken or missing a feature eh?

Welllllll, it just might be.  Do me a favor and check the following:

- [ ] Issue does not already exist
- Identify exactly what aspect you're issue is about
  - [ ] ignite base applicattion
  - [ ] ignite the cli
  - [ ] ignite generated code
