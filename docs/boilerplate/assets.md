# Assets Folder

The `assets` folder is for icons, images, fonts, and other static assets used in your app.

### App Icons

For your App Icon, use [Ignite's App Icon Generator](../../concept/Generators/#app-icon-generator) to automatically generate image assets, which get put in `assets/images`.

### Splash Screen

To update your Splash Screen, use [Ignite's Splash Screen Generator](../../concept/Generators/#splash-screen-generator) to generate images and update `assets/images`.
