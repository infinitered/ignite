# app.json / app.config.js

The app.json & app.config.js files are used to configure your React Native / Expo project.

Ignite has already configured several things for us:

- App Icons - configured for iOS, Android, and Web. Check out [App Icon Generators](../../concept/Generators#app-icon-generator) to update your App Icon.
- Splash Screen colors and images - configured for iOS, Android, and Web. Check out [Splash Screen Generators](../../concept/Generators#splash-screen-generator) to update your Splash Screen.
- Expo plugins for things like localization and splash screens

See [Expo's Documentation on App.json Configuration](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/configuration/) for more details.
