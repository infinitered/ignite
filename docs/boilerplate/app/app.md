# `app` folder

The vast majority of your code will live in the `app` folder. This is where you'll spend most of your time.

In this folder, there's only one file ([app.tsx](./app.tsx.md)). The rest are folders for containing components, models, screens, and more.

- [app.tsx](./app.tsx.md) - The main entry point for your app
- [components](./components/Components.md) - Reusable components
- [config](./config/Config.md) - Configuration files
- [devtools](./devtools/Devtools.md) - Configuration/setup for Reactotron and other dev tools
- [i18n](./i18n/Internationalization.md) - Internationalization setup
- [models](./models/Models.md) - MobX-State-Tree models
- [navigators](./navigators/Navigation.md) - React Navigation navigators
- [screens](./screens/Screens.md) - The main screens of your app
- [services](./services/Services.md) - Services, such as API clients
- [theme](./theme/Theming.md) - Theme files
- [utils](./utils/Utils.md) - Utility functions and hooks
